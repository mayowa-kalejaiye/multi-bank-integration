## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Standard Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mayowa-kalejaiye/multi-bank-integration.git
cd multi-bank-integration

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Development Installation

For development work with all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from banking import BankAccount

# Create a primary account
primary = BankAccount(2000, "Primary Account")
primary.provider = "WarpSpeed"

# Create accounts with other providers
secondary = BankAccount(500, "Secondary Account") 
secondary.provider = "OtherBank"

# Link accounts together
primary.link_external_account(secondary)

# Make some transactions
primary.deposit(100, "Salary deposit")
secondary.withdraw(50, "Grocery shopping")

# Check consolidated balance
total_balance, total_savings = primary.get_consolidated_balance()
print(f"Total balance across all accounts: ${total_balance:.2f}")

# Transfer between accounts
primary.transfer_between_accounts("OtherBank", 300)

# View transaction history
primary.full_transaction_history()
```

## Detailed Usage Guide

### Creating Bank Accounts

Bank accounts are the core entities in the system:

```python
# Basic account creation
account = BankAccount(initial_amount=1000, account_name="My Account")

# With custom credit limit
account = BankAccount(1000, "My Account", credit_limit=500)

# Set the financial provider
account.provider = "PalmPay"  # Or any other provider name
```

### Basic Transactions

```python
# Deposit with auto-savings (default is 5%)
account.deposit(100, "Salary deposit")  # 5% goes to savings automatically

# Customize auto-savings percentage
account.enable_auto_savings(10)  # Now 10% of deposits go to savings
account.deposit(100)  # $10 goes to savings, $90 to available balance

# Withdraw funds
account.withdraw(50, "Grocery shopping")

# Using operators (for simple cases)
new_account = account + 100  # Deposit analogue
new_account = account - 50   # Withdrawal analogue
```

### Loans and Credit

```python
# Request a loan
loan_result = account.borrow(500, loan_type="personal")
if loan_result.success:
    print(f"Loan approved! New balance: ${loan_result.new_balance:.2f}")

# Repay a loan
repayment_result = account.repay_loan(200)
if repayment_result.success:
    print(f"Loan payment processed. Remaining loan: ${account.loan_manager.loan_balance:.2f}")
```

### Account Linking and Multi-Bank Features

```python
# Link external accounts
primary.link_external_account(secondary_account)

# View consolidated balance
total_balance, total_savings = primary.get_consolidated_balance()

# Transfer between accounts
result = primary.transfer_between_accounts("SecondaryBank", 300)

# Unlink an account
primary.unlink_account("SecondaryBank")
```

### Security Features

```python
# Lock an account
account.lock_account()

# Trying to perform operations on locked account
try:
    account.withdraw(100)  # Will raise SecurityException
except SecurityException as e:
    print(f"Operation failed: {e}")

# Unlock with verification code
success = account.unlock_account("1234")  # Returns True if successful
```

### AI Services

```python
from banking import AIServices

# Fraud detection
is_suspicious = AIServices.fraud_detection(transaction_amount=1000, account_avg=200)

# Budget analysis
spending_by_category = AIServices.smart_budgeting(account.transactions)

# Currency conversion
converted_amount = account.convert_currency(100, "USD", "EUR")
```

### Serialization and Persistence

```python
# Serialize account to dictionary
account_data = account.serialize()

# Save to file
import json
with open("account_backup.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(account_data, f, indent=2)

# Restore from serialized data
restored_account = BankAccount.deserialize(account_data)
```

## Key Components

### BankAccount (account.py)

The central class that integrates all components and provides the main API. Notable features:

- **Core account operations**: Deposits, withdrawals, balance tracking
- **Special methods**: Operator overloading for intuitive operations
- **Composition pattern**: Integrates specialized components
- **Transaction history**: Complete record of all account activities

### AccountLinking (account_linking.py)

Handles the integration of multiple accounts from different providers:

- **Thread-safe operations**: Ensures data consistency with locks
- **Account registry**: Maintains references to all linked accounts
- **Consolidated views**: Aggregates data across accounts
- **Inter-account transfers**: Moves funds between accounts

### LoanManager (loan.py)

Manages loan-related functionality:

- **Multiple loan types**: Personal, auto, mortgage, and business loans
- **Interest calculation**: Different rates based on loan type
- **Approval algorithms**: AI-based loan approval prediction
- **Repayment processing**: Handles loan repayments and status updates

### SecurityManager (security.py)

Handles account security and access control:

- **Account locking**: Prevents unauthorized operations
- **Authentication**: Verifies access credentials
- **Security event logging**: Tracks security-related events
- **Failed attempt tracking**: Locks accounts after too many failures

### AIServices (ai_services.py)

Provides AI-powered financial services:

- **Fraud detection**: Identifies suspicious transactions
- **Budget analysis**: Categorizes spending patterns
- **Currency conversion**: Provides exchange rate predictions
- **Service resilience**: Automatic retry for temporary failures

### Models (models.py)

Defines data structures and type definitions:

- **Transaction**: Represents financial transactions
- **TransactionResult**: Standardized operation results
- **Enumerations**: Type-safe constants for status and types
- **Exception classes**: Specialized error types
- **Protocol definitions**: Interface contracts

### Utils (utils.py)

Contains shared utilities and helper functions:

- **Logging**: Configures system-wide logging
- **Decorators**: Cross-cutting concerns like transaction logging
- **Context managers**: Transaction safety with rollback
- **ID generation**: Secure unique identifier creation

## Advanced Features

### Transaction Safety

All critical operations are wrapped in a transaction context that ensures atomic operations:

```python
with transaction_context(account):
    # Operations that should be atomic
    account.balance -= amount
    # If an exception occurs, balance is automatically restored
```

### Thread Safety

For multi-threaded environments, the system uses locks to ensure data consistency:

```python
# In AccountLinking class
def transfer_between_accounts(self, to_provider, amount):
    with self._lock:  # Thread safety
        # Safe transfer implementation
```

### Custom Exception Hierarchy

The system uses specialized exceptions for different error scenarios:

- **BalanceException**: For insufficient funds
- **SecurityException**: For security violations
- **LinkingException**: For account linking errors

### Type-Safe Enumerations

Instead of string constants, the system uses enums for type safety:

```python
class TransactionType(enum.Enum):
    DEPOSIT = "deposit"
    WITHDRAWAL = "withdrawal"
    TRANSFER = "transfer"
    # ...other types...
```

### Dataclasses for Clean Data Handling

For data-centric structures, Python's dataclasses reduce boilerplate:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class TransactionResult:
    success: bool
    message: str
    amount: float
    new_balance: float
    timestamp: datetime = dataclasses.field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    # ...other fields...
```

## Extending the System

### Adding New Transaction Types

1. Add the new type to the TransactionType enum in models.py
2. Implement handling for the new type in the BankAccount class
3. Update serialization/deserialization methods if needed

### Creating New AI Services

1. Add a new static method to the AIServices class
2. Implement the AI algorithm or API integration
3. Consider adding retry logic for external service calls

### Supporting New Account Features

1. Identify which component should own the feature
2. Implement the feature in the appropriate module
3. Expose the functionality through the BankAccount API if needed

### Adding External Banking API Integration

1. Create a new module (e.g., `external_apis.py`)
2. Implement provider-specific API clients
3. Integrate with AccountLinking for real-time data synchronization

## Technical Design Decisions

### Why Composition Over Inheritance?

The system uses composition (has-a) rather than inheritance (is-a) because:

1. It provides more flexibility in combining behaviors
2. It allows each component to evolve independently
3. It avoids the "diamond problem" of multiple inheritance
4. It creates a cleaner separation of concerns

### Why Protocol Classes?

Protocol classes (structural typing) are used instead of abstract base classes because:

1. They're more flexible, focusing on behavior rather than hierarchy
2. They help avoid circular import issues in modular designs
3. They align with Python's "duck typing" philosophy

### Why Dataclasses?

Dataclasses are used for data-centric structures because:

1. They reduce boilerplate code for simple data containers
2. They automatically generate useful methods (**init**, **repr**, etc.)
3. They support immutability (frozen=True) for safer data handling

### Why Context Managers for Transactions?

Context managers are used for transaction safety because:

1. They ensure proper setup and teardown regardless of exceptions
2. They make transaction boundaries explicit in the code
3. They centralize rollback logic for consistency

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings in Google style format
- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility

### Testing Recommendations

- Write unit tests for each component in isolation
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Use property-based testing for financial calculations
- Test thread safety with concurrent operation tests

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally
2. Update documentation for any new features
3. Add appropriate test coverage for changes
4. Get code review from at least one team member

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing for Large Transaction Volumes

For systems handling many transactions:

1. Consider implementing transaction batching
2. Add indexing for transaction queries
3. Implement pagination for large transaction histories

### Memory Management

To optimize memory usage:

1. Consider lazy loading of transaction histories
2. Implement pagination for large linked account lists
3. Use generators for processing large datasets

### Concurrency Optimization

For high concurrency scenarios:

1. Consider using connection pooling for external APIs
2. Implement more granular locking strategies
3. Use async/await for IO-bound operations

## Security Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- Account locking after failed attempts
- Verification codes for sensitive operations
- Permission checking before operations

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data hashing in credential storage
- Immutable credential objects (frozen dataclasses)
- Clear separation of authentication concerns

### Transaction Security

- Rollback capability for failed transactions
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Fraud detection on unusual activities

## Software Engineering Practices

The WarpSpeed Banking System implements several software engineering best practices:

### Object-Oriented Programming Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Each component encapsulates its internal state and implementation details
- **Abstraction**: High-level interfaces hide underlying complexity
- **Polymorphism**: Different account types and transaction processors share common interfaces
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification

### Design Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: BankAccount provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystems
- **Decorator Pattern**: Transaction logging decorators add functionality without modifying core code
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different loan approval algorithms can be swapped at runtime
- **Observer Pattern**: Notification system for account events
- **Factory Method**: Used for creating different transaction types

### Architectural Approaches
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between components with well-defined interfaces
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Components are composed rather than using deep inheritance hierarchies
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
- **Immutable Data**: Transaction records are immutable once created

### Concurrent Programming
- **Thread Safety**: Locks protect shared resources during concurrent access
- **Atomic Operations**: Transaction contexts ensure operations complete fully or not at all
- **Non-blocking Algorithms**: Used where appropriate to improve performance

### Other Modern Practices
- **Type Hints**: Python type annotations for better tooling and code quality
- **Protocol Classes**: Structural typing for flexible interfaces
- **Context Managers**: Used for resource management and transaction safety
- **Defensive Programming**: Input validation and error checking throughout the codebase

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Circular Import Errors

**Problem**: Errors about circular imports between modules.
**Solution**: Use relative imports or move interface definitions to avoid cycles.

#### Thread Safety Issues

**Problem**: Inconsistent state when using multiple threads.
**Solution**: Ensure all state-modifying operations use the appropriate locks.

#### Transaction Failures

**Problem**: Transactions fail without clear reasons.
**Solution**: Check the logs for transaction context errors and ensure proper context usage.
